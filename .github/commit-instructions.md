Follow the Conventional Commits format strictly for commit messages. Use the structure below:

```
<gitmoji><type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]
```

Guidelines:

1. **Gitmoji**: Include a relevant `gitmoji` that best represents the nature of the change.

2. **Type and Scope**: Choose an appropriate type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`) and optional scope to describe the affected module or feature.

3. **Description**: Write a concise, informative description in the header; use backticks if referencing code or specific terms.

4. **Body**: For additional details, use a well-structured body section:
   - Use bullet points (`*`) for clarity.
   - Clearly describe the motivation, context, or technical details behind the change, if applicable.

Commit messages should be clear, informative, and professional, aiding readability and project tracking.
